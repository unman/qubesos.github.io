  <b>Note:</b> If you're interested in the privacy of Qubes OS, or other digital privacy topics, such as Whonix and Tor, then this is <b>not</b> the page you're looking for. Please see <a href="/faq/#how-does-qubes-os-provide-privacy">FAQ: How does Qubes OS provide privacy?</a>

  On the other hand, if you <em>are</em> interested in our privacy policy, then you've come to the right place!<br>The short version is that we try to respect your privacy as much as possible. We absolutely do not sell any user data.

You can read the privacy policy for our website [here](../privacy)

Qubes also provides repositories at https://yum.qubes-os.org and https://deb.qubes-os.org.
We collect data when you access these repositories, including date and time of access, details of packages downloaded, and originating IP address.
This is so that we can generate [user statistics](../statistics).
We keep this data for 2 months.

Qubes provides an [onion site](http://www.qubesosfasa4zl44o4tws22di6kepyzfeqv3tg4e3ztknltfxqrymdad.onion) and onion mirrors of the repositories.  
Access to these servers is not logged.

There are also other [mirrors](../downloads#mirrors) of Qubes repositories.  
Qubes has no control over, or access to, data collected at these mirrors.
